Description
-----
Determining cancer subtypes and patient prognosis analysis are important tasks of cancer research. The massive amount of multi-omics data spawned by high-throughput sequencing technology is an important resource for cancer prognosis, and deep learning methods can be used to effectively integrate multi-omics data to identify more accurate cancer subtypes. <br>

ProgCAE, a prognostic model based on convolutional autoencoder (CAE) to predict patient survival subtypes using multi-omics data. 

ProgCAE can predict cancer subtypes with significant survival differences on 12 cancers and outperforms traditional statistical methods on most cancers. ProgCAE is highly robust, its predicted subtypes can be used to construct supervised classifiers.

Dependencies
-----
ProgCAE is implemented in Python 3.9, which also requires the installation of keras, lifelines, numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy tensorflow and other packages. Their specific versions are as follows.<br>
### packages
`keras`         `2.6.0`<br>
`lifelines`     `0.27.2`<br>
